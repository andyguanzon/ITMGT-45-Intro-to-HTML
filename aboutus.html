  <p>Café, also spelled cafe, small eating and drinking establishment,
  historically a coffeehouse, usually featuring a limited menu; originally these
   establishments served only coffee. The English term café, borrowed from the
   French, derives ultimately from the Turkish kahve, meaning coffee.</p>
  <p>The introduction of coffee and coffee drinking to Europe provided a much-needed
   focus for the social activities of the sober. The first café is said to have
   opened in 1550 in Constantinople; during the 17th century cafés opened in Italy,
   France, Germany, and England.</p>
